              "The wondrous backdrop of white summits in the still winter air has fascinated sports enthusiasts for years. In fact, even though nobody really knows where this hidden place is to be found, there are people who claim that snowboarding was invented in this very location. Legend says, several decades ago, a particularly inventive man linked a pair of skis together to create a surfboard-like contraption. Combining the ideas of snow and surfing, he basically built a snurfboard that became extremely famous very soon. Within weeks, snurfers all over the world began to manufacture their own snurfing equipment and found their way here to glide down the (until that point) untouched mountains in the snow. There may not have been slopes or lifts or anything but snow, but people truly loved this place. This is where all the craziness allegedly began—in the snow desert that is nowhere to be found."

Granted, it is a lift without a safety bar, but you’ve got hands, right? Just find something, anything, to hold on to during the ride and you’ll probably be just fine."

Be sure to try it out, but it is highly recommended that you wear snow goggles and extremely resilient snow boots; otherwise, you will very likely find yourself drenched, frozen and unable to walk or see for at least two hours after you’ve finally crossed the finish line, preferably in one piece."

              "Snow tubing is a fabulous alternative for everyone who has always wanted to see what floating tires are capable of outside their natural habitat. You can even go night skiing or snowboarding, if you don’t mind the lack of light, as the concept of floodlit pistes has, unfortunately, not reached this little neck of the woods just yet. However, riding down the mountain in the moonlight certainly has its charm for night owls who can’t get enough of the pleasures of winter sports. And if all of these options are too adventurous for your taste, this place features a unique hiking trail through the amazingly idyllic winter landscape, along which you may even see some bears."

              "As for sleeping arrangements, the mountain’s lonely little hut usually has a couple rooms available. In case it doesn’t, you can always build an igloo. They are actually warmer than you would think. If they weren’t, how would business models like igloo hotels—where, so they claim, you don’t freeze to death while you sleep—be able to survive? But if you don’t like igloos, you can go for a nice mountain cave too, though you may have to share it with some carnivorous animals. And if you’re lucky, you can even find a cave that looks like the ice queen’s palace—enjoy some pretty snow art before bed and feel like Elsa for a day! "

              "As you carve your way through the Alps, there are marvelous attractions to enjoy. The most significant highlights are naturally the slopes themselves. Imagine perfectly prepared pistes you can run down like a pro, framed by the softest and brightest deep powder snow, where both skiers and snowboarders can get their money’s worth and all their dreams fulfilled. Provided that the winter sporting adventure has been scheduled conveniently. Ideally, you pick a week where every normal person has to work and you’re the only lucky genius who gets to play in the snow. Alternatively, if you play your cards right, you may be able to befriend the owner of the ski lifts. Or you get creative in some other way, to ensure that nobody besides you and your friends will stand “in line” when the first cable car opens at 9 a.m. Whichever way you go about it, if you actually manage to secure the entire skiing and snowboarding region for yourself, you’ve done everything right. You’ve made it. You’ve figured out the mystery of skiing in the Alps. Why? Because of one single, extremely crucial fact: There will be no skiers standing or lying around the slopes, because they thought they could ski without actually knowing how to ski. And there will be no excruciatingly annoying snowboarders either, who are sitting around in a row in the middle of the slope—the most appropriate place imaginable—because they’re too lazy to get back up and keep doing what they came here to do."

              "But there is another attraction unique to the Alps, which makes the experience of doing winter sports in the midst of incapable skiers and inconsiderate snowboarders slightly more bearable, if not actually fun. In fact, it provides a great exit strategy—quite literally. It’s made of wood, it has a roof, and it serves drinks. It’s called a ski hut. Or a mountain hut. Or simply hut. Sometimes a cabin."

When the winter starts turning into spring, you no longer have to stop by a hut just to keep your feet from turning into ice (by the way, if you press them up against the tiled stove, they will burn). You can actually stop by the hut for fun! Sit down outside in the warmth, wearing your snow boots combined with sunglasses rather than snow goggles, and enjoy the scenery, as the amazing blanket of white reflects the glittering sunlight."

Or until you eventually turn into the Iceman, also known around the world as “the frozen mummy”."

At least until you hit the next hut, which is typically about 50 meters away. Now, here is an important piece of information: You’re not really supposed to ski or snowboard after you have had a schnapps (or ten); there are huts that offer to bring you back to your hotel by snowcat if you’ve drunk your way through the entire bar by order of après-ski. By the way, as a side note: The huts serve food as well. Mostly apple strudel and schnitzel and fries. If you’re lucky, they even have something nutritious too—like sausages."
